## üöÄ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` package manager
- A virtual environment tool like `venv` (recommended)

### 1. Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/manjushagolla/Job-Authenticity-Checker.git <br>
cd Job-Authenticity-Checker


### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
**Create virtual environment**
python -m venv venv

**Activate it
On Windows:**
venv\Scripts\activate
**On macOS/Linux:**
source venv/bin/activate
## 3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

## 4. Train the Model (One-Time Step)
**a. Download the Dataset:**
Get the dataset from Kaggle: <br>
- Fake Job Postings Dataset

- Place fake_job_postings.csv in the root folder.

**b. Run the Training Script:**

python train.py <br>
This will create:

- fake_job_model.joblib

- tfidf_vectorizer.joblib

## 5. Run the Streamlit App


streamlit run app.py <br>
Then open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.
