# üõ°Ô∏è Job Authenticity Checker

An intelligent web application built with Python and Streamlit that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect fraudulent job postings. This tool provides a layer of security for job seekers by analyzing job details and flagging potentially fake listings.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your own machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   `pip` package manager
-   A virtual environment tool like `venv` (recommended)

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
Use code with caution.
Markdown
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.
Generated bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Use code with caution.
Bash
3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required libraries from the requirements.txt file.
Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Bash
4. Train the Model (One-Time Step)
The main app requires pre-trained model files. Run the train.py script to generate them. You'll need the original dataset for this step.
a. Download the Dataset:
Go to the Kaggle Fake Job Postings Dataset page.
Download the data and place fake_job_postings.csv in the root of the project folder.
b. Run the Training Script:
Generated bash
python train.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
This will create two files: fake_job_model.joblib and tfidf_vectorizer.joblib.
5. Run the Streamlit App
Now you can launch the main application!
Generated bash
streamlit run app.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
Your browser should automatically open to the app running on http://localhost:8501.
‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
This application is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.
Repository: The code is pushed to this public GitHub repository.
Deployment: Streamlit Cloud is linked to the repository and automatically builds and deploys the app upon any new commit to the main branch.
Required Files for Deployment:
app.py
style.css
requirements.txt
fake_job_model.joblib
tfidf_vectorizer.joblib
üìà Model Overview
The prediction model is a Logistic Regression classifier trained on a dataset of over 17,000 real and fraudulent job postings. The core NLP workflow involves:
Text Cleaning: Lowercasing, removing punctuation, and stripping stopwords.
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" -> "run").
Vectorization: Using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the text into numerical vectors that the model can understand.
This approach allows the model to learn the patterns and keywords that are most indicative of a fraudulent post.
